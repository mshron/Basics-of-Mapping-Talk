Slides and code from Max Shron's talk on the nuts and bolts of mapping.

* `shpUtils.py` and `dbfUtils.py` are both by Zachary Forest Johnson, and mention so in the code.
* `mapbasics.py` is by Max Shron, and is little more than a few hacked together subroutines. Use at your own risk.

To use this code, use `shpUtils.loadShapefile` to load a shapefile, `mapbasics.make_dict` to create a NAME -> list of arrays format from the shapefile, and then `mapbasics.mercatorify` or `mapbasics.lambertify` to project the contents.

Happy hacking!
